# esp32-quadruped-robot-web-control
ESP32-based quadruped robot with inverse kinematics, gait control, obstacle avoidance, and web-based control, and advance function.
## Note on Code Availability
Certain components related to beacon-based navigation and higher-level
decision logic are not included in this repository due to ongoing
intellectual property and patent-related work. The published code
demonstrates the complete low-level control, inverse kinematics,
gait planning, obstacle avoidance, and web-based command handling.
